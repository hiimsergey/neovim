Get started with cloning this repository. On Linux, it would be something like this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hiimsergey/neovim ~/.config/nvim && nvim
```

In the editor, you first have to bootstrap the [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) plugin manager. Ignore the error message, press `\b` and await the message `Installed lazy.nvim successfully! Please restart nvim!` in the command bar. Then restart nvim.
